# Impossible Maze Game

**Impossible Maze Game** is a web-based interactive project built for the *“Useless Project” Hackathon*. It challenges the conventions of game design by offering a deliberately frustrating, unwinnable experience.

## About the Project

This game was intentionally designed to have no purpose or reward. The player’s cursor is locked at the center of the screen, while the maze itself moves based on the user’s mouse movement. Any contact with the black maze walls causes the game to reset.

There is no win condition—even reaching the red-bordered region does nothing. The game exists purely to frustrate the player and waste time, aligning perfectly with the theme of the hackathon.

## Gameplay Features

- Cursor is fixed at the center of the screen.
- The maze image moves relative to mouse movement.
- Touching any wall instantly resets the game.
- There is no exit, no score, and no progression.
- Even navigating to the red borders which is supposed to be an exit will results in Loosing.

This project is not meant to be "played" in the traditional sense—it’s an artistic statement disguised as a game.
