## Project Description

A browser-based maze game designed to be completely useless and impossible to win. Built for the “Useless Project 2.0” Hackathon, it traps the player in a game that leads nowhere and resets endlessly.

## The Problem (that doesn't exist)

Sometimes life gives you too many choices and achievable goals. What if we solved the “problem” of accomplishment by creating something with *zero possibility of success*?

---

## The Solution (that nobody asked for)

An impossible maze where the cursor is fixed at the center and the maze moves around it. Touch a wall? Game resets. Reach the red border? Still lose. Designed entirely to be unplayable, frustrating, and ultimately... pointless.
